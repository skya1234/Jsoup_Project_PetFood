Debby, Unverified Purchase, 8/6/2022, 5 out of 5 stars review, It's a little larger than I thought it would be, but it's a good size. My little 5 lb Lulu likes it and my 30 lb Bella has no trouble at all relaxing in it. I haven't had it long enough to comment on how it is to clean. It is sufficiently plush on the bottom to give them a comfy place to sleep if it's placed on the floor. I put it on my couch as I figured they would more likely check it out quicker there, but I may move it to the floor, just haven't decided where yet. I recommend this bed, I don't think you'll be sorry if you get it for your fur-baby.
Darla253, Unverified Purchase, 8/4/2022, 5 out of 5 stars review, I've purchased many dog and cat beds for the house full of furbabies, however, this is the first one they've all loved. At first I wasn't impressed because the shape didn't appear right. After a few minutes in the dryer on low it looked fluffy and great. Highly recommend!
TJMc, Unverified Purchase, 10/23/2022, 5 out of 5 stars review, Nice couch like bed for fluffy or fido! Will hold a small to medium dog, and our black lab has actually squeezed her big behind into it a couple of times. We constructed bed, very fluffy, has arms and a back like a couch. Has a bean bag base to it so it wont go sliding all over the place. Zippered botrtom as well for easy removal for laundering. Soft velvety feel to it. Dogs loved it right away. Recommended for all pets.
nacevedo88, Unverified Purchase, 8/11/2022, 2 out of 5 stars review, When this bed showed up I liked the size and I thought the print was cute. I have a 15 pound terrier mix as well as a 45 pound amstaff mix and each of them fit well on the bed. It felt a bit bare inside to me, but I waited until my pups could really try it out before I developed my opinion. The second I put it on the floor my dogs were all over it. They love pillows and beds and being comfortable. They continued to use it over the next few days, but as the days passed, the inside began to scrunch up in random places as well as flatten out even more than it already was. My pups gradually stopped using it, and I feel the only reason they used it to begin with was because it had a little more cushion than the carpet. Disappointed with this one...
Drimeth, Unverified Purchase, 8/8/2022, 5 out of 5 stars review, My cat is a HUGE fan of this pet bed! It's very soft with a nice outside design, exactly as shown on the website. She's only about 8lbs, but even so the bed holds up nicely and doesn't dip down when she uses it (which is constantly!). I think it'll be great for the colder months too because of how soft it is!
WhyThough, Verified Purchase, 3/6/2023, 1 out of 5 stars review, Be aware that there is conflicting information all over the place regarding the bed. The picture shows that it is 21" by 17" and appropriate for dogs up to 25 pounds including Jack Russell terriers, and I bought it based on that. In reality it only 19” by 15” (according to the tag on it) and appropriate for very small dogs (supposedly under 15 pounds according to the tag). My 11-pound cat fills it up. It will fit inside a cat carrier. It is much too small for my 17 pound terrier. I see that the descriptive material (NOT in the pictures) is halfway correct. I should have looked more closely. I thought this was the same (larger) bed I bought at Walmart for $5. Nope. It costs more and is smaller and more cheaply made. Bummer.
AprilT, Unverified Purchase, 8/6/2022, 5 out of 5 stars review, Received my Small Lounger Pet Bed and our cat loves it. She roams all day and night so haven't gotten a picture of her in it since I go to bed early. It's super soft and machine washable. Super fluff bed and she went straight to it and sniffed it and finally laid down. We have 3 cats so each one will use this bed if not all of them at once. It's like a fleece wrapped bed. I recommend it for all your fur babies for maximum comfort. I love the sides and the back pillow. My pets love it. Super neat bed.
Cecil, Unverified Purchase, 8/16/2022, 5 out of 5 stars review, Our small dog and two cats went to lay on their new bed and the dog won the prize! This bed is so nice, I'd sleep on it if it were big enough. The small size is perfect for our 12 pound pooch. She seems very comfortable even with the summer weather. The low sides provide enough height to ward off drafts, but allow for cooling air across the pet. The button-tufted build keeps the soft back, front and bottom pillow in form. The sides, without tufted buttons, are generously filled to form the perfect places for her to rest her head. The fabrics will wash well and the light weight will not overload our washing machine. This bed is a good choice for each of the furry kids.
Besttapeever, Unverified Purchase, 8/4/2022, 4 out of 5 stars review, It is a pretty good bed it is a light weight bed. I thought it would be a bit bigger than what it is. I guess the measurements are to the outside and it seems a bit smaller. My dog fit in it ok once he laid down. As you can see in the picture it is not a very big bed maybe better for cats or smaller dogs. My dog is not a big dog probably average size smaller dog. It is pretty well made and soft. I like the fact it doesn't weigh a lot because I plan to use it when I travel and it will fit nice in my vehicle and give him a nice place to lay down on. Over all he liked it and was happy laying in it. So do recommend it. Just make sure you check the size for what size pet you have.
imrachie, Unverified Purchase, 8/5/2022, 5 out of 5 stars review, This, "Small Lounger Pet Bed", is a hit right away with all 5 of my cats! This *Vibrant Life Small Lounger*, has very soft material and the cushioned sleeping area along with the bolstered surrounding walls are super comfortable for my cats to rest in. Not only do my cats love this but I do as well because it's machine washable. It measures 17" x 21". Although the info included with this bed says it's for pets up to 20lbs., my cat in the picture I added is 23lbs. and he likes and fits in it absolutely fine! Awesome pet bed for cats, dogs or whatever.
Bre, Verified Purchase, 9/7/2023, 3 out of 5 stars review, Sizes do not match across the product description. Title shows medium up to 40lbs but dimensions match those shown with the small bed in photo not the sizes shown on medium photo. Ordered hopeful it would be the medium. When it came it says medium and up to 50lbs, which also does not match, but again dimensions match those found with small bed up to 25lbs. Not a great sale price for the small bed. A little thin but that was expected for the price and this was just an extra to put in tent when camping
Pam, Verified Purchase, 10/20/2023, 2 out of 5 stars review, First of all it took way to long to get here. I've never had to wait this long. And they sent the wrong size bed. It was supposed to be 19×15. Instead I got 17×13. Would have sent back, but had already opened it. This is the second thing in a row I ordered that was Funky.
Sophie, Verified Purchase, 10/13/2023, 2 out of 5 stars review, As another reviewer mentioned, the size bed you will receive is smaller than stated in the product description. You will order this for your fat cat, and then end up receiving a smaller bed which you could have just purchased the other listing for less! Can't even ask for a discount or reship, you have to “start a return”. Inner lining is darker than the listing (excuse my flash which distorts this a bit) but I prefer this darker shade.
Jessica, Verified Purchase, 2/25/2024, 5 out of 5 stars review, Love the color and pattern. Soft and snuggly and so far sides have held up and not lost their form even when constantly laid on.
Lorisyfrett, Verified Purchase, 2/11/2024, 5 out of 5 stars review, it was just as i thought it would be. it is cute durable and.most of all prissy loves it. i will probably buy another one.
Duchess, Verified Purchase, 1/2/2024, 5 out of 5 stars review, This was the perfect size for my cats, so I bought this one after choosing the gray for my dog. Now my 4th furbaby will NOT sleep in my room unless we have the bed. Hehe.
TexasGigi, Verified Purchase, 11/22/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, Good price and quality. From the moment our Shih Tzu saw this bed, she claimed it as hers. The big Lamb Chop didn't make out as well as evidenced by the stuffing on the floor by her bed.
MKU74, Verified Purchase, 11/15/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, we have seven cats and they're all fighting over this bed I need to order a few more. they love it!! white cat in the pic weighs around 16 lbs and the 20lb one fits too!
Jody, Verified Purchase, 1/31/2024, 4 out of 5 stars review, Started out for the dog only waaay too small so it is now a cat bed for two kitties to sleep in. They love it
Booyatobits, Verified Purchase, 1/28/2024, 5 out of 5 stars review, My dogs love these pillows. I have tried other pillows but they were never as soft to the touch or as easy to clean.
Mia, Verified Purchase, 9/3/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, Very nice bed for the price. Bought it for my golden, Lila, after the kelpie, Poppy, ate the last one. Lila still sleeps on the floor. At least Poppy likes it.
Nardia, Verified Purchase, 10/24/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, I loved it, my pit was actually a tiny bit smaller than what I got but he loved it to it's like day before being trashed. Comfy, durable, worth it for pups.
Shaq, Verified Purchase, 8/10/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, I LOVE this bed and so does my puppy. He tugs and pulls at it and is unable to break through the material to take the stuffing out. I highly recommend this for small dogs
btalbs, Verified Purchase, 10/6/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, I buy 2 of these every couple of years. 1 for the crate and one to move around the house. Great bed. Made well, comes apart to wash and super soft. Big enough for my Doberman and both maltipoos. I recommend this bed to everyone!
Watcher, Verified Purchase, 10/29/2023, 1 out of 5 stars review, All four sides on the top started fraying! Purchased 40 days ago and it hasn't been moved. Nice size for a very small dog. Such a shame it's either manufactured to save to much fabric or the workmanship was shoddy.
Charlesa, Verified Purchase, 10/8/2023, 3 out of 5 stars review, It's a nice, soft dog bed; however, it's smaller than expected. The measurements in the picture are incorrect. It also says this is for dogs up to 25 pounds. When the item arrived, the tag has for dogs up to 15 lbs.
Richelle, Verified Purchase, 8/30/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, He loves it! 65lb dog snuggles in with his blankie every day. He's a scratch 15xs and spin 30x before he lays down and it's holding up fine! No tears or rips!
Luz, Verified Purchase, 9/14/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, My baby girl loves her bed. When her bed comes in she get excited and she lays on in all day. We have purchased about 4 beds. She has one in her cage and the other she lays on in during the day.
sunflowergirl07, Verified Purchase, 9/25/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, This is perfect for my dog Cody who weighs approx 28 lbs. He can curl up on it or sleep on his side. He likes it very much. I purchased the black design.
Amarae, Verified Purchase, 4/13/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, This is great! My 80lb lab mix needed another bed, so I got this one because he's still growing, he's got more than enough room on it. Even my boyfriend likes laying on it!!
Dylan, Verified Purchase, 3/14/2023, 1 out of 5 stars review, Bed seemed like a really good bed but I can’t tell if someone touched it while it was in the store or if my dog just straight up doesn’t like this one. Within one week it was constantly being torn to shreds or at least he was trying I have to stop him every hour from trying to chew on this one and he doesn’t even try to chew his other 2 beds
Dink, Verified Purchase, 5/13/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, Small dog bed for small dogs. Our LITTLE doggie loves these beds, we bought 4, three for the house and one for car. This is a small bed, will fit small dogs, or cats, we have a Yorkie. Have not washed one yet, but for the price, these seem well made with good material.
Ramona, Verified Purchase, 4/19/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, As soon as I put the bed down, my dog leaped into the bed!! 😁 💞 I have two Chihuahuas and they took turns laying in it, although there is room for both (5 lbs each). They will not sleep on the other bed anymore because this one is the new favorite. It is perfect for them to lay their head on the side and fall asleep. Their own little couch 🤗 It makes me happy to see them so content and comfortable 💞
, Verified Purchase, 6/25/2023, 4 out of 5 stars review, My dog loves her bed! Her other one was hard to wash, had way too many holes, and held on to every piece of lint. This one is easy to wash. However, after the first wash the buttons became detached and caused holes. I sewed them up and washed her bed a different time and that same spot opened up again. No stuffing came out either time. For the most part it's durable. Overall, we still like it.
Amethyst, Verified Purchase, 6/10/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, My dog Buttons fell in love with this pillow! I had another at my other home for 13 yrs that he laid on once %26 never even looked at again but this one he rolled around on %26 made it his own right away. He comes to work with me %26 I thought he deserved something better than just a blanket on a hard, cold floor. He's so spoiled!
Jen, Verified Purchase, 2/8/2024, 4 out of 5 stars review, Cute and comfy, my dog likes it. Great value.
HazelEyes, Verified Purchase, 2/10/2024, 5 out of 5 stars review, My dog is 21 lbs. He fits perfectly when curled up.
LAMDILLIGAF, Unverified Purchase, 10/22/2022, 5 out of 5 stars review, We have a 11 week old French Bulldog and she LOVES her HUGE bed. The bed is so soft and easy to wash when it gets dirty. It had a bottom sanitation pad you can remove and wash also if your puppy makes a mess. It's heavy enough she can bounce around and do her zoomies in it and it stays in place. 100% approved!!!
TarrahV, Verified Purchase, 11/10/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, We needed a fairly large but padded bed for our 7 month old lab who recently just lost one of his legs in a freak accident. He loves it.
Tien, Verified Purchase, 12/9/2023, 3 out of 5 stars review, The ad said it would fit 25 lbs dogs but the tag on the product says 15lbs. So it was a bit small for my 18 lbs shih tzu.
natrisha, Verified Purchase, 1/20/2024, 5 out of 5 stars review, dogs love sleeping on the pet bed
mercedes, Verified Purchase, 1/16/2024, 5 out of 5 stars review, its cute for small dogs or if u have a puppy !
Anne, Verified Purchase, 1/29/2024, 5 out of 5 stars review, Room for 1 adult or several kittens
susan, Verified Purchase, 2/1/2024, 5 out of 5 stars review, Good quality and price. Dogs love it
Ricardo, Verified Purchase, 7/26/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, I love the quality, my puppy is happy to have his own bed. It's a little be bigger than I thought but it's perfect!
billie, Verified Purchase, 7/11/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, My yorkies love it. Not too big and not too small. The stuffing is the right amount so that it's not flat in spots.
Hanna, Verified Purchase, 9/2/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, Bed is nicer then expected, fits my Great Danes' and they love it. It also snaps on both corners, making it easy to travel. Super soft as well.
PattiG, Verified Purchase, 9/10/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, Good bed for the price. My Yorky loves it. Bought it for vacation but he used it before we left. Now I can't get him out of it
Lilly, Verified Purchase, 8/12/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, Papas loves his bed!!! I'm very satisfied with my purchase 🥰 baby loves it and I love that he does!
Angie, Verified Purchase, 10/14/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, Great little bed especially for the very low price! Our Jack Russel fits in it perfectly! Going to get another one for another room.
Amy, Verified Purchase, 6/25/2023, 2 out of 5 stars review, Within 1 day the material inside easily collapses and moves to the edges causing the bed to have a huge dip in the entire center leaving your pet to be on the ground again. I had to give him a fluffy blanket to add for comfort.
Nichole, Verified Purchase, 5/19/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, My dogs love it! They are both over 55lbs and can squeeze together in one so definitely spacious with a nice raised pillow all around for them to lay their heads. So great I bought a second!
Sweetiedarlin64, Verified Purchase, 6/6/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, Good for very small animals. I have 2 little dogs and they seem happy with these beds. Even the cat is trying to use them. As you can see in the pics, I have 2 tiny dogs, who normally want to sit on my lap. But now they each have their own beds.
, Verified Purchase, 4/21/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, My cats love these! I have a Siamese and a Scottish fold and have one cuddled for each, they love sleeping in it and the material is great! Good quality and value!
Tania, Verified Purchase, 11/16/2023, 1 out of 5 stars review, This arrived ripped from my delivery
Jennifer, Verified Purchase, 11/20/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, My babygirl came home to her forever home and she absolutely loves her bed.
Luvbug, Verified Purchase, 11/17/2023, 5 out of 5 stars review, I got one for my cat and one for my friends Chihuahua. They love the comfort of the bed.

Faith, Verified Purchase, 12/22/2023, 1 out of 5 stars review, Way too small. Looked bigger in your photo
